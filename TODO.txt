==================================
// SHORT TERM OBJECTIVES
==================================
--> Create a global helper class; 'ConfigManager', that will provide acess to JSON and LUA files/scripts.
--> Adapt text rendering shader to be GLSL 1.50 (GL 3.2) compliant.
==================================
// IDEAS/FUTURE
==================================
--> GUI
    -> The components MUST NOT know how to draw themselves.
    -> In the draw func, all components will be looped and their geometry
       packed in the tightest way possible, and least amount of calls.
--> LUA: yeh. Do that somehow.
--> Ask http://thehitgame.co.uk/ how does he handle the phone-rendering camera.
