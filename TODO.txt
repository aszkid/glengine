==================================
// SHORT TERM OBJECTIVES
==================================
--> URGENT: Change pointer design. Use UNIQUE-PTRs, return RAW or
    WEAK-PTRs. Ownership is clear, reduce useless usage of quirky stuff.
--> Implement as quick as possible a 2-state rendering system:
	- GUI
	- 3D scene
--> Implement, therefore, a GUI interface.
--> Use the messaging system: the first real test will be the UI.
